GGOverlay (or Groggy Gaming Overlay) is a lightweight lobby based overlay that I built to use with my group of friends. 

We started a tradition during Covid of playing games remotely while talking on discord, and every once and a while we would make a drinking event out of it. 

See my website for more information on how it works and how to use it. https://alexander.prucka.com/index.php/projects/ggoverlay

To use the overlay, download the GGOverlayRelease zip file from the Releases tab in github, then extract and run setup.exe. GGOverlay will then install and appear in your windows start menu.

If you enjoy using it, and there are any features you think would be useful, feel free to create a PR and implement the feature changes.

Cheers, Alex.
